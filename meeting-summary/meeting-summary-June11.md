## Meeting 06/11/2018

1. we need to have a summary after meeting.
2. Hao's requirement file, question specification document.
3. Hao and yitao should have media data and city data.
    911 data is too big, so hao will copy it on Chicago Hack Night
    
4. News data, existed project here, read their code.
5. Data visualization, visualization of city crime data is really easy.
    but for news data, we need to face the duplication and clean the data.
    for example there are a lot of location for a single news, and because of the data sources, some of the news didn't happen in chicago.
