3. Hao and yitao should have media data and city data.
    911 data is too big, so hao will copy it on Chicago Hack Night with thumb drive.
    Now we only have data of the first half of 2017.

4. News data, existed project here, read their code.
> I might write some documentation for their project.

5. Data visualization, visualization of city crime data is really easy.
    but for news data, we need to face the duplication and clean the data.
    for example there are a lot of location for a single news, and because of the data sources, some of the news didn't happen in chicago.
