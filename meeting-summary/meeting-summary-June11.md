## Meeting 06/11/2018

1. We need to have a summary after every meeting.
> The first meeting summary I will write it later.

2. Hao's requirement file, question specification document.
> I will post it later.

3. Hao and yitao should have media data and city data.
    911 data is too big, so hao will copy it on Chicago Hack Night with thumb drive.
    Now we only have data of the first half of 2017. 
> I will send it to Yitao by other ways. 

4. News data, existed project here, read their code.
> I might write some documentation for their project.

5. Data visualization, visualization of city crime data is really easy.
    but for news data, we need to face the duplication and clean the data.
    for example there are a lot of location for a single news, and because of the data sources, some of the news didn't happen in chicago.
> Argamon told about using the artilce words to identify them whether a same crime or not.

6. 


















1000. **important** first clean the 911 data and make a single csv file.
